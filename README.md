# ByeFly
A pseudo-random flyswatter using two servos and an Arduino

Created at Fab Fest Bali in 2022 at a table in the Colab Cafe as a demonstration project using simple, pre-plugged Arduino components and programmed using ArduinoDroid on an Android phone.

The two servos, fitted with horns, are run with their axes at right angles to each other. So the first (base) servo has a shaft pointing vertial. The second servo body is placed flat against the horn on the first servo such that its drive shaft axis is horizontal.

The original "swatter" was a piece of orange paracord outer bound at one end and frayed out. This was tied flexibly to a loop in the end of a piece of stiff steel wire approx 350mm long with paracord inner thread. The other end of the wire was firmly attached to the horn of the second servo.

When the two servos are activated, this thrashes the "swatter" around a hemisphere in a repeating pseudo-random manner. Anecdotally this kept files off the food. To raise the swatter above the food, a beer bottle was taped to the cafe table and the first servo duct taped to the neck of the bottle aligned vertically. Subsequent versions used a more broad-based bamboo tripod, and other support designs are left as an excercise to the diligent student.

An analogue joystick with click button may optionally be attached. The A0 and A1 inputs will control servo motion, while the A2 input is connected to the joystick switch and serves to enter and exit manual control mode.
